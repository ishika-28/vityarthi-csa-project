## Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Overview of the project
This project will pridict diabetes risk for users by analysing features with the basic machine learning model. It helps the users to understand their risk factors and encourage early actions based on real data.
## Features
1. Collects user inputs such as: age, weight, blood pressure, glucose and family history.
2. Trains and test models on example data.
3. It predicts whether a user is at risk for diabetes.
4. Shows model accuracy and prediction results.
## Technologies/Tools used
 Python3
 pandas
 scikit-learn
## Steps to install and run the project
