## Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Overview of the project
This project will detect diabetes risk for the users by understanding features with the basic machine learning model. It helps the users to understand their risk and encourage early actions based on the data.
## Features
1. It Collects user inputs such as: age, weight, blood pressure, glucose and family history.
2. It trains and test the models on example data.
3. It predicts that the user is at risk for diabetes or not.
4. Shows the model accuracy and prediction results.
## Technologies/Tools used
1. Python3
2. pandas
3. scikit-learn
## Steps to install and run the project
1. Download the project files.
2. Install the required modules:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
3. make sure that the python3 is installed on machine.
4. Open the terminal or python IDE.
5. Run the main script:
   python_diabetes.py
6. follow more prompts or review the output.
## Instructions for testing
1. check the included sample code, for example patient records.
2. Modify the data section to test with your own health feature values.
3. Observe that how the predictions and the accuracy scores are changing.
