## Problem statement
Diabetes affects millions of people around the world, and many cases even go undiagnosed until serious symptoms develop. Making early predictions based on basic health data can help people become aware of their risk and encourage them to take preventive measures. The aim of this project is to create a small tool using machine learning to predict diabetes risk using features like age, weight, blood pressure, glucose level, and family history.
## Scoope of the project
The project focuses on providing a simple, friendly prediction system for basic health testing. It accepts health information from a user and returns a risk assessment (high or low) for diabetes. It does not replace medical advice but it offers users a quick, informative estimation. All major machine learning steps are covered— data input, model training, prediction, and result interpretation. The workflow is kept logical and clear, so users and reviewers can follow each step from data entry to final results.
## Target users
This project is made for students, teachers , and anyone who wants to understand and demonstrate the fundamentals of Ai and machine learning using real word medical example. It is especially useful for the people who are new to machine learning or interested in practical health applications. Infact the code is simple enough to be understood and extended by beginners.
## High-Level Features
It collects five basic health measurements from the user (age, weight, blood pressure, glucose, family history)Stores example data in a table for model training and testing uses logistic regression to make a classification: diabetes risk yes/no returns the prediction instantly and reports model accuracy includes code comments and easy-to-edit parameters for classroom use, allows evaluation with new data and shows practical test results.
